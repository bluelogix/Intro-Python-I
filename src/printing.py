"""
Python provides a number of ways to perform printing. Research
how to print using the printf operator, the `format` string 
method, and by using f-strings.

x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
# x is 10, y is 2.25, z is "I like turtles!"
print("%s" % z, "%i" % x, "%.2f" % y)
# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing
print(" {} {} {:.2f}".format(z,x,y))
# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
print(f'{z} {x} {y:.2f}')
